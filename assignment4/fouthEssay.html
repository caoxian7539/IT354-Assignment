			<div class="w3-container w3-border w3-large">
			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHaving come into light just a few years ago, microservices are an accelerating trend these 
			days. Indeed, microservices approach offers tangible benefits including an increase in scalability, 
			flexibility, agility, and other significant advantages. Netflix, Google, Amazon, and other tech leaders 
			have successfully switched from monolithic architecture to microservices. Meanwhile, many companies consider 
			following this example as the most efficient way for business growth.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOn the contrary, the monolithic approach is a default model for creating a software application. Still, its trend is going down because building a monolithic application poses a number of challenges associated with handling a huge code base, adopting a new technology, scaling, deployment, implementing new changes and others.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo is the monolithic approach outdated and should be left in the past? Will microservices
			application help you reach your business goals better?In my article, I are going to compare microservices 
			with the monolithic architecture, outline the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, and find out which 
			software architecture style will be the best fit for your business.</p><br>
			<h3>MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE</h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe monolithic architecture is considered to be a traditional way of building applications. A monolithic application is built as a single and indivisible unit. Usually, such a solution comprises a client-side user interface, a server side-application, and a database. It is unified and all the functions are managed and served in one place.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNormally, monolithic applications have one large code base and lack modularity. If developers want to update or change something, they access the same code base. So, they make changes in the whole stack at once.</p>
			<h4>Strengths of the Monolithic Architecture
			</h4>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLess cross-cutting concerns.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEasier debugging and testing. </p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSimple to deploy. </p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSimple to develop.</p>
			<h4>Weaknesses of the Monolithic Architecture</h4>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUnderstanding. When a monolithic application scales up, it becomes too complicated to understand.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMaking changes. It is harder to implement changes in such a large and complex application with highly tight coupling.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspScalability. You cannot scale components independently, only the whole application.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNew technology barriers. It is extremely problematic to apply a new technology in a monolithic application because then the entire application has to be rewritten.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE</h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhile a monolithic application is a single unified unit, a microservices architecture breaks it down into a collection of smaller independent units. </p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWithin a microservices architecture, the entire functionality is split up into independently deployable modules which communicate with each other through defined methods called APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Each service covers its own scope and can be updated, deployed, and scaled independently.</p>
			<h4>Strengths of the Microservices Architecture
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIndependent components. </p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEasier understanding.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBetter scalability.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFlexibility in choosing the technology</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe higher level of agility.</p>
			<h4>Weaknesses of the Microservice Architecture</h4>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspExtra complexity. </p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSystem distribution.A microservices architecture is a complex system of multiple modules and databases so all the connections have to be handled carefully.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCross-cutting concerns. When creating a microservices application, you will have to deal with a number of cross-cutting concerns. They include externalized configuration, logging, metrics, health checks, and others.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTesting. A multitude of independently deployable components makes testing a microservices-based solution much harder.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>HOW TO CHOOSE FROM THOSE TWO ARCHITECTURE?</h3>
			<h4>Choosing a monolithic architecture</h4>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSmall team. </p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA simple application.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNo microservices expertise. </p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspQuick launch. </p>
			<h4>Choosing a microservices architecture</h4>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMicroservices expertise.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA complex and scalable application.</p>.
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEnough engineering skills. </p>
