			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGoogle fonts: I like it. Using a combination of different fonts actually increase the content and 
			beauty of your website.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBackground color: he added a lightblue to the header background. This is what I always ignore in my own websites, 
			and I should learn from this.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe used the flex operation in css to make every division equal in length. 
			I like this very much because it is completely new to me. I used a lot of operations 
			to set the lengths and margins before and now I learn a super efficient way to do it!
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor the <b>align-items: center</b> operation, I don’t likeit. In my view, he made the whole style worse.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe <b>justify-content: space-around</b> is new to me and very useful. It left equal space to three links 
			and made the style nicer.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI like the way to gives the introduction text linear-gradient color. I tried it before in my website 
			and it truly added beauty to the whole style.</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe way he added an animation to the computer is really cool. I like it! I never thought of adding 
			animation to something before and now I can’t help starting using it to make my websites more elegant
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe way he made the whole pages responsive on different devices was new to me. 
			I used Bootstrap to realize responsive pages before and now I know the theories behind it.

			<h2 style= "text-align: center">Three Usability Mistakes</h2>
			<h3>1.Tiny Clickable Areas</h3>
			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI’ve always clicked the wrong links or can’t click on the right link I want because 
			the hyperlinks are too small. Hyperlinks are designed to be clicked, so to make them usable, 
			it makes sense to ensure that they’re easy to click. Our hand movement with the mouse isn’t very precise, 
			so designers must ensure that the users have a large clickable area.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you can’t leave much space for every single hyperlink or make it big, 
			one way you can do is to increase the padding of it. Even if it’s small, 
			the user has low probability to click on the wrong links.
			</p>
			<h3>2.No Way to Get In Touch</h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUser engagement is important if you want to build a successful websites and social apps. 
			Quickly answering user’s question and solving their problems mean that you have good customer service 
			and you care about your users. As a result, the probalitiy that you users appreciate your products 
			and recommend to others will increase. This is an era of information exchange and social media. Almost everyone
			communicate to others and people are inclined to have interaction with others. Your website will be out of date
			and abondoned by the users if there is little space for users to get in touch with each other or get answered.
		    </p>
			<h3>3.Long Registration Forms</h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRegistration forms are barriers. They are barriers because it takes effort to fill them in,
			and the task itself is no fun. I will have anxiety and impatience if the website I visit have a long 
			registration and a lot of text to fill.To solve this, we can shrink this barrier by making the registration 
			process as short as possible. Delete those information that you don’t need and serves little important. 
			Show only what the users truly need to register and the rest can be filled in later.

			<h2 style= "text-align: center">10 Usability in Web Design</h2>
			<h3>1. 2-Second-Rule</h3>
			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPeople will feel anxious and impatient if I wait too long for website response. 
			A loose principle is that a user shouldn't wait more than 2 seconds for a system response. Remember that
			the less time user have to wait, the better is the user experience.
			</p>
			<h3>2. Permit easy reversal of actions.</h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspExperienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the 
			interface and that the interface responds to their actions. 
			They don’t want surprises or changes in familiar behavior, 
			and they are annoyed by tedious data-entry sequences, difficulty in obtaining necessary 
			information, and inability to produce their desired result. 
		    </p>
			<h3>3.Satisficing</h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWeb users don’t prefer optimal ways to find the information they’re looking for. 
			They aren’t interested in the most reasonable and sound solution to their problem. 
			Instead they permanently scan for quick solutions which are “good enough”. 
			Applied to Web, satisficing describes exactly this approach: users settle with a solution to a
			problem that is “good enough” — even if alternative solutions can better fulfill their requirements 
			in a long run.
			</p>
			<h3>4. 3-Click-Rule </h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPeo are inclined to stop using the site if they can't find the information
			they need within 3 mouse clicks. 3 clicks is a little bit exaggerated, but it points out that users 
			want to find the information they need as soon as possible. To conclude, designer must make sure that 
			the websites have clear navigation , logical structure and easy-to-follow site hierarchy.
			</p>
			<h3>5. You don't use too small font sizes </h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI have long passages in which words are small and hard to read. People will probability
			close your website if they find it very hard to look for information. Don't use small font sizes and make
			your page easy to read.
			</p>
			<h3>6. You make it easy to contact you </h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMaybe some website creator don't want to be contacted by visitor, but this may leads to
			user loss because they want to contact you and they can't find any contact information. If you seek better
			development of your websites, leave easy-to-find contact information and interact with users.
			</p>
			<h3>7. You have at most one animation per page </h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBlinking images can attract user's eyeballs and increase content richness. But too 
			many blinking images will distract users from reading your content and make them anoyed. Use at most one
			animation per page.
			</p>
			<h3>8. Eye-Tracking </h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEye tracking is the process of measuring either the point of gaze (
			“where we are looking”) or the motion of an eye relative to the head. Using eye-tracking studies
			can help to estimate how comfortable users are with your website and how they understand the structure
			and system behind it.
			</p>
			<h3>9. Readability </h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspReadability describes the degree to which the user can understand the content 
			of your website, based on the complexity of sentences and the difficulty of vocabulary. Indexes for readability
			of your website are supposed to be based on the age or knowledge level of your users. You should create simple
			and readable content if your users are mostly teenagers. 
			</p>
			<h3>10. Granularity </h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGranularity is the degree to which a large, usually complex data set or 
			information has been broken down into smaller units. Granularity is crucial when you display content
			that is long, difficult and full of terminology. People feel impatient and hard to continue if your
			content is a whole page where all things are bundled together. Spliting complex data or information into smaller 
			units can bring ease and readability to readers

			<h2 style= "text-align: center">5 Key Principles of Good Website Usability</h2>
			<h3>1. Availability and Accessibility</h3>
			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf people try to access your website and it doesn’t work — 
			for whatever reason –your website becomes worthless.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSome basic rules of availability and accessibility:<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>Server uptime</b>: Invest in good hosting and ensure your
			server is stable and fast.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>Broken links</b>: Double check there are no dead links.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>Mobile responsiveness</b>： Make sure your site can handle different screen sizes 
			and slow connections.
			
			</p>
			<h3>2. Clarity</h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe core of Usability is clarity. If you distract or confuse your visitors, they will need more 
			time to find what they came for. Either way, they will not experience your website and chances are that they 
			leave with no intention of coming back. 
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is your job to help visitors reach their goals as quickly as possible. If you can manage
			to do that, your visitor will leave a good impression on your website and you have laid the groundwork for a 
			good website.
			</p>
			<h3>3. Learnability</h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLearnability is another important aspect of usability.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt should be your goal to design intuitive interfaces — 
			interfaces that don’t require instructions. Key to intuitive design is to 
			make use of what people already know, or create something new that is easy to learn.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you use new concepts in your design, make sure to use them consistently and
			give people a hand during the initial learning phase. People like theose sites that are clean and easy
			to navigate. 
			</p>
			<h3>4. Credibility</h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEven if people are able to find what they came for, if they don't trust you,
			all of your effort is worthless. Therefore, it is crucial to let people know that you are a real company
			with real stuff working there. You can offer a clear "About Us" page to provide contact details and 
			company description to visitors.
			</p>
			<h3>5. Relevancy</h3>
			<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is not enough that your website is clear, your content must also be relevant.
			In other words, you must know who the users are and why they visit your website.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFirst of all, define who your users are. Second, communicate with them to know what their
			goals are. Third, create user scenarios that illustrate in which situation people visit your site to find 
			what kind of content.
