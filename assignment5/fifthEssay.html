			<h1 style="text-align:center">THE MITT ROMNEY WEB FONT PROBLEM</h1>
			<div class="w3-container w3-border w3-large">
			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is a font problem in website that is called The Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT),
			or the browser hides the text while the web font is loading.</p>
			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe author wanted to highlight a particular variant of FOIT, which was the 
			Mitt Romney Web Font Problem. This specific problem occurs when you use multiple weights and styles of the same 
			typeface together.</p>
			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHere is what happened: In January, James Muspratt tweeted a image. The headline from 
			Slate.com was important breaking news about Mitt Romney’s intention to run for President. 
			The headline was rendered using the Titling Gothing FB typeface but using two different web fonts, 
			one for bold and one for combination bold and italic. The readers couldn't see the italic variation.
			</p>
			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<Strong>Why did this happen?</Strong> As you may already be aware, each web font incurs its own separate FOIT. 
			By combining two web fonts together in a single headline, the FOIT has created a race condition that alters the 
			integrity of the content. A glance at the headline indicates that Mitt Romney is indeed running for President. 
			When the page finishes loading, the real message is revealed: he is, in fact, not running for President. 
			Obviously, this is bad, and especially so for a news organization that depends on clarity and accuracy.</p>
			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf the font-end developers are unware of this problem, things may be serious. Let's consider situations
			like this: One website says that Lebron James is not greater than Michael Jordan. Because of FOIT, "not" is gone and
			the news becomes "Lebron James is greater than Michael Jordan". The topic will be completely different because of this.
			Situations can be the same for other areas. The views of the author may be totally different because of this font problem</p>
			<h2><Strong>How to deal with this problem?</Strong></h2>
			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1.You can use the font loading solution I’ve been prescribing and documented over at Dev.Opera. 
			This is by far the easiest method and will eliminate FOIT by switching to unstyled fallback text while the font is 
			loading.</p>
			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2.If you aren’t comfortable with eliminating FOIT, 
			you can also group your font loads into a single repaint, shown in the Appendix 1 code sample below.</p>
			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3.You can also use the previously documented Flash of Faux Text approach, 
			utilizing font-synthesis to show browser generated bold and italic fallbacks while the real web fonts load.</p>
			<h2><Strong>WHAT SHOULD WEB BROWSERS DO?</Strong> </h2>
			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspweb browsers should fix this problem natively. They should apply the blocking font-rendering 
			behavior in a smarter way. The browser knows when it is loading multiple @font-face fonts of the same typeface that have matching font-family properties and vary only by font-weight and font-style.</p>
			<P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</p>
