			<h2>What is ECMAscript?</h2>
			<p>ECMAScript is a scripting-language <strong>specification</strong> standardized by Ecma International.</p>
			<h2>The relationship between ECMAscript and Javascript</h2>
			<p>In November 1996, Netscape, the creator of JavaScript, decided to submit JavaScript to the standardization body ECMA in the hope that the language would become an international standard.</p>
			<p>Therefore, the relationship between ECMAScript and JavaScript is that the former is a specification of the latter, and the latter is an implementation of the former</p>
			<h2>ECMAscript versions</h2>
			<p>There are ten editions of ECMA-262 published. Work on version 10 of the standard was finalized in June 2019.</p>
			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>ES6 took 15 years from inception to release.
			ECMAScript 1.0 was released in 1997, followed by ECMAScript 2.0 (June 1998) and ECMAScript 3.0 (December 1999) in the following two years. 
			Version 3.0 was a huge success, gaining widespread support in the industry, becoming the standard, laying the foundation for the basic syntax of the JavaScript language, 
			which will be fully inherited in future releases. To this day, when beginners start learning JavaScript, they're actually learning the syntax of version 3.0.</p>
			<p>In March 2013, the ECMAScript 6 draft was frozen and no new features were added. New feature ideas will be put into ECMAScript 7.</p>
			<p>In December 2013, draft ECMAScript 6 was released. Then there is a 12-month period of discussion and feedback.</p>
			<p>In June 2015, ECMAScript 6 was adopted as an international standard. It's been 15 years since 2000.</p>
			<h2>Features</h2>
			<p>The ECMAScript language includes <Strong>structured</Strong>,<Strong>dynamic</Strong>,<Strong>functional</Strong>, and <Strong>prototype-based</Strong> features</p>
